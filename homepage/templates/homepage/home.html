                    <p>I'm one part Field Tech, one part Web Developer! That means that I get
                        to spend half my time programming, and the other half troubleshooting hardware!
                        I'm fluent in both Javascript and Python, and have experience with frameworks like
                        Bootstrap, React, Node, and Django. I also have experience using databases such as
                        SQL, Maria DB, and MongoDB.
